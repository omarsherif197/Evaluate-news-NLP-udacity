This project uses the meaningcloud API. The user enters his input in the form, then it is checked to see if it is a valid URL using the URL function. If it is not a valid URL, an alert shows up on the user's screen telling him to input a valid URL, otherwise a call is made to the backend with the given URL and the backend calls meaningcloud's API. The response is received and sent to the frontend, where it is displayed.
